# QCirc Specification

The QCirc Specification defines an easy way of describing quantum and digital circuits in JSON format. This standard is the resulting output from parsing of the QEDA Intermediate Representation

## Basics

QCirc is a JSON formatted circuit representation resulting from parsing and optimization of the QCode Intermediate Representation

```json
"qubits" : [
    "0": {
    	"type": "quantum",
    	"state": 1 or 0,
    	"gates": [ X, CXC, CXT, ...],
    },
	"1": {},
	...
]
```
